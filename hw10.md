#### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from this class session.
#### 2. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?
**Tight Coupling:**
Definition: Tight coupling occurs when one class depends heavily on another class's implementation. Changes in one class often require changes in the dependent class.
Example: If ClassA creates an instance of ClassB inside its methods and directly calls ClassB's methods, then ClassA is tightly coupled to ClassB. If ClassB changes, ClassA may also need to change.
Downsides: Makes the code less flexible and harder to maintain. Testing is also more difficult because classes are intertwined.
**Loose Coupling:**
Definition: Loose coupling means that classes depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces) rather than concrete implementations. Components interact via contracts (like interfaces), making them independent of the specific implementation.
Example: ClassA relies on an interface InterfaceB rather than a concrete class ClassB. ClassA doesn't care about how ClassB does its work; it only knows that InterfaceB has certain methods.
Advantages: Makes the system more flexible, maintainable, and testable. Components can be modified or replaced without affecting other parts of the system.

**Spring IOC**
Inversion of Control: Spring IoC is a design principle in which the control of object creation, configuration, and lifecycle management is inverted and handed over to the Spring container.
What it does: Instead of components managing their own dependencies, the Spring IoC container manages them. The container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling objects (called beans).
How it enables loose coupling: By using Dependency Injection (DI), Spring injects dependencies into a class from outside rather than the class creating its dependencies itself. This promotes loose coupling as classes don’t need to know about the concrete implementation of their dependencies.

#### 3. What is MVC pattern?
**1. Model:**
Purpose: Represents the data and the business logic of the application. The model directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
Responsibilities:
Interacts with the database or other data sources.
Encapsulates the business rules.
Notifies the view when the data changes (in some MVC implementations, like in JavaScript frameworks).

**2. View:**
Purpose: Represents the UI (User Interface) or the presentation layer. The view displays data from the model to the user and sends user input back to the controller.
Responsibilities:
Renders the data from the model in a way that is suitable for user interaction.
Receives updates from the model when the data changes and updates the UI accordingly.

**3. Controller:**
Purpose: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input from the view, manipulates the model, and updates the view accordingly.
Responsibilities:
Receives input from the user through the view.
Updates the model based on user input or other events.
Decides which view should be displayed in response to an action.

#### 4. What is Front-Controller?
**Single Entry Point:**
The front controller acts as the central point through which all requests pass. Instead of having multiple controllers handling different requests directly, every request is routed through this single controller.
**Request Handling:**
The front controller receives the client's request and decides how to handle it by dispatching it to the appropriate components (e.g., specific controllers, services, or views).
**Routing:**
One of the front controller’s main tasks is to map incoming requests (usually URLs) to appropriate actions (such as invoking a specific controller method).
**Common Processing:**
Centralizing request handling allows common functionality like authentication, authorization, logging, and request validation to be processed in one place before passing control to specific parts of the application.

#### 5. Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works.
The DispatcherServlet is a core component of the Spring MVC framework that acts as the Front Controller. It handles all incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to the appropriate handler (such as controllers, services, or views) based on the configuration and routing logic.
How DispatcherServlet Works in Spring MVC:
**Client Request:**
A client makes an HTTP request (e.g., requesting a web page or submitting a form).
**DispatcherServlet Initialization:**
At application startup, the DispatcherServlet is initialized by the web container (like Tomcat). It reads the Spring configuration (like applicationContext.xml or Java configuration) to set up necessary components (handlers, view resolvers, etc.).
**Receiving the Request:**
All requests are mapped to the DispatcherServlet. This is typically done through a URL pattern like / or /app/* in the web.xml file or using annotations in modern Spring applications.
**Handler Mapping:**
The DispatcherServlet uses HandlerMapping to map the incoming request to a specific controller method based on the request URL.
Example: If the request is /home, the DispatcherServlet consults the HandlerMapping to find a matching method in a controller that can handle this URL.
**Calling the Controller:**
Once the appropriate controller method is identified, the DispatcherServlet delegates the request handling to that method.
The controller processes the request, interacts with the business logic (services), and typically returns a logical view name (e.g., "home") and/or a model (data) to be displayed.
**View Resolution:**
After the controller has processed the request, the DispatcherServlet uses a ViewResolver to resolve the logical view name (e.g., "home") into a specific view file (e.g., home.jsp or a Thymeleaf template).
The view name returned by the controller is matched to the actual view file by the ViewResolver.
**Rendering the View:**
The resolved view is rendered (typically as HTML) using the model data provided by the controller, and the response is sent back to the client.

#### 6. What is JSP and What is Model And View？
JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a server-side technology in Java that allows the creation of dynamic web content. JSP is primarily used to develop presentation layers for web applications, often by embedding Java code into HTML pages. It is part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) technology stack and is commonly used in MVC (Model-View-Controller) frameworks like Spring MVC.
ModelAndView is a class in Spring MVC that holds both the model (data) and the view (presentation) needed to process a request and return a response to the user. It encapsulates both the logical view name and any model data that should be rendered by the view, providing a clear separation between business logic and presentation logic.

#### 7. Explain servlet and servlet container , name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat
A **Servlet** is a Java class used to handle HTTP requests and responses in a web application. It is part of the Java Servlet API, which defines how web servers can interact with Java programs to process client requests (typically over HTTP) and generate dynamic responses.
A **Servlet Container** (also called a web container) is a part of a web server or application server that provides the runtime environment for executing servlets. It manages the lifecycle of servlets, handles request/response communication, and provides services like security, concurrency, and session management.
Apache Tomcat: The most widely used open-source servlet container. Tomcat implements the Servlet and JSP specifications.
Jetty: A lightweight, open-source servlet container used in a variety of applications, including embedded scenarios where the web server is bundled inside the application.
Eclipse GlassFish: The reference implementation of the Java EE platform (now Jakarta EE), which includes servlet, JSP, and other specifications. GlassFish provides both servlet container and full Java EE application server capabilities.
