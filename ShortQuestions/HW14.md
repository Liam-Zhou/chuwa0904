# HW14 Testing II

## 1. Explain and compare following concepts, provide specific examples when doing comparison

## Testing Concepts

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Definition**: Focuses on testing individual components or functions of a software, usually in isolation from other parts of the system.
- **Example**: In a calculator app, testing a function that performs addition would involve verifying that `add(2, 3)` returns `5`.
- **Comparison**: It is more granular compared to other types of testing like integration and functional testing, making it suitable for identifying bugs at a low level.

### 2. Functional Testing

- **Definition**: Tests the software's functionalities against requirements/specifications, ensuring that features work as expected.
- **Example**: Testing if the login feature in an application works by entering valid and invalid credentials.
- **Comparison**: Unlike unit testing, functional testing is more focused on the overall functionality of the software rather than individual components.

### 3. Integration Testing

- **Definition**: Tests the interaction between integrated modules or components of a software system.
- **Example**: After developing both the login module and user dashboard module, an integration test might verify that a user is correctly redirected to the dashboard upon successful login.
- **Comparison**: This type of testing bridges the gap between unit and functional testing by focusing on how different modules work together.

### 4. Regression Testing

- **Definition**: Tests existing functionality to ensure that new code changes have not introduced new bugs.
- **Example**: After fixing a bug in a login feature, regression testing ensures that other features like password reset or user profile updates remain unaffected.
- **Comparison**: Regression testing often includes unit, integration, and functional tests to ensure stability throughout the application, making it broader in scope.

### 5. Smoke Testing

- **Definition**: A quick test to verify that the basic functions of the software work and that it is stable enough for further testing.
- **Example**: Verifying that an e-commerce siteâ€™s homepage loads, users can log in, and basic navigation works.
- **Comparison**: It is often a subset of functional testing and is faster, intended to catch major issues early before proceeding with more in-depth tests like regression or performance testing.

### 6. Performance Testing

- **Definition**: Measures how well a software performs under a specific workload in terms of speed, responsiveness, and stability.
- **Example**: Testing a website to ensure that it can handle 10,000 concurrent users without slowing down.
- **Comparison**: Unlike other testing types which focus on correctness, performance testing assesses the efficiency and capacity of the system.

### 7. A/B Testing

- **Definition**: Compares two versions (A and B) of a software feature to determine which one performs better based on user behavior.
- **Example**: An e-commerce site might show two different checkout page designs to different user groups to see which design leads to higher conversion rates.
- **Comparison**: This type of testing is user-centric and focuses on optimizing user experience rather than ensuring functionality or stability.

### 8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- **Definition**: Performed by the end users to verify if the software meets their needs and is ready for deployment.
- **Example**: A client testing a custom CRM solution to ensure it matches their business processes before accepting the final product.
- **Comparison**: UAT is the final testing phase before the software is deployed and involves stakeholders rather than developers or QA engineers, distinguishing it from other testing methods.

## Environment Concepts

### 1. Development Environment

- **Definition**: Used by developers to write and test their code.
- **Example**: A developer writing and testing a new feature locally on their machine or in a shared dev server.
- **Comparison**: It is more prone to changes and often unstable, making it suitable for rapid development and debugging, unlike the more stable environments like QA or production.

### 2. QA (Quality Assurance) Environment

- **Definition**: Used by testers to verify that the software functions as expected before it is released to users.
- **Example**: A QA team running regression tests on a newly built version of an application to ensure existing functionalities are intact.
- **Comparison**: This environment is more stable than development and resembles production, but it is strictly for testing purposes and not used by end users.

### 3. Pre-prod/Staging Environment

- **Definition**: A near-replica of the production environment, used for final testing before deployment.
- **Example**: A new feature is tested in staging with data that closely mirrors production data to identify any last-minute issues.
- **Comparison**: Staging is closer to production than QA, serving as the last checkpoint before a release. It allows for tests that mimic real-world conditions, which might be too sensitive or risky to perform directly in production.

### 4. Production Environment

- **Definition**: The live environment where the software is available to end users.
- **Example**: A social media application where users create accounts, post updates, and interact with each other.
- **Comparison**: Unlike other environments, production is highly stable and any issues in it have a direct impact on users, making thorough testing in earlier environments essential before deployment here.
