### 1. List and explain all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
### 2. What is the lifecircle of Junit?

1. Class Level Setup `@BeforeAll`
2. Setup `@BeforeEach`
3. Test Execution `@Test`
4. Cleanup `@AfterEach`
5. Class Level Cleanup `@AfterAll`

### 3. Explain parameterized testing?

This feature enables us to execute a single test method multiple times with different parameters.

### 4. Explain Mockito and PowerMock .

Mockito is a mocking framework, Java-based library that is used for effective unit testing of Java applications.  
PowerMock is a framework that extends other mock libraries.  

### 5. Compare @Mock and @InjectMock

`@Mock` is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. `@InjectMock` is used to inject mocked objects.  
Note you must use @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) or Mockito.initMocks(this) to initialize these mocks and inject them (JUnit 4).
With JUnit 5, you must use @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class).
```java
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) // JUnit 4
// @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) for JUnit 5
public class SomeManagerTest {

   @InjectMocks
   private SomeManager someManager;

   @Mock
   private SomeDependency someDependency; // this will be injected into someManager

   // tests...

}
```
```java
class Game {

    private Player player;

    public Game(Player player) {
        this.player = player;
    }

    public String attack() {
        return "Player attack with: " + player.getWeapon();
    }

}

class Player {

    private String weapon;

    public Player(String weapon) {
        this.weapon = weapon;
    }

    String getWeapon() {
        return weapon;
    }
}
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
class GameTest {

   @Mock
   Player player;

   @InjectMocks
   Game game;

   @Test
   public void attackWithSwordTest() throws Exception {
      Mockito.when(player.getWeapon()).thenReturn("Sword");

      assertEquals("Player attack with: Sword", game.attack());
   }

}
```
### 6. Explain stubbing .



### 7. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
### 8. what is Hamcrest Matchers
### 9. Compare @spy and @Mock?
### 10. Explain Assertion .
### 11. Add unit tests for CommentServiceImpl under Redbook->branch 10_testing (fork or copy the project https://github.com/CTYue/springboot-redbook),
1. Enrich logics inside CommentServiceImpl methods, add if-else conditions in each methods.
2. In CommentServiceImpl, add following method, remove modelMapper dependency, and replace all
   modelMapper.map() with this method, write unit test for commentServiceMapperUtil
3. method coverage and branch coverage for CommentServiceImpl should be 100% (as much as you
   can), .
