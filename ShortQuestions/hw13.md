## Homework 13

### 2. What is the lifecycle of JUnit?: The lifecycle of a JUnit test can be summarized as follows:

@BeforeAll: Runs once before all tests in the class.
@BeforeEach: Runs before each test method.
@Test: The actual test method.
@AfterEach: Runs after each test method.
@AfterAll: Runs once after all tests are complete.

### 3. Explain parameterized testing: 

Parameterized testing allows you to run the same test with different parameters. In JUnit 5, you use the @ParameterizedTest annotation along with different sources of parameters, such as @ValueSource, @CsvSource, or a method that provides data.

### 4. Explain Mockito and PowerMock:

Mockito: A popular mocking framework in Java that allows the creation of mock objects for testing. It enables you to define behavior, verify interactions, and simulate different scenarios in tests.
PowerMock: An extension to Mockito that allows mocking static methods, constructors, and final classes that Mockito does not support directly.

### 5. Compare @Mock and @InjectMocks:

@Mock: Creates a mock instance of a class or interface.
@InjectMocks: Automatically injects the mocks into the object being tested. It helps to initialize the class under test and automatically injects the mocks into it.

### 6. Explain stubbing: 

Stubbing is the process of providing predefined responses or behaviors to a mock object when specific methods are called. This allows the test to simulate real scenarios and control the behavior of the mock.

### 7. What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers: 

Mockito's ArgumentMatchers class provides methods like any(), eq(), etc., to match method arguments when verifying or stubbing. They allow flexible matching of arguments in mock interactions.

### 8. What are Hamcrest Matchers: 

Hamcrest is a library that allows writing declarative and readable assertions using matchers. For example, you can write assertions like assertThat(actual, is(equalTo(expected))) to express conditions more fluently.

### 9. Compare @Spy and @Mock:

@Mock: Creates a mock object that does not invoke real methods unless explicitly stubbed.
@Spy: Creates a spy object that invokes real methods by default but can still be stubbed or verified like a mock.

### 10. Explain Assertion: 

Assertions are statements used in unit tests to check that the actual output of the code under test matches the expected result. Common assertions include assertEquals(), assertTrue(), and assertThat().
