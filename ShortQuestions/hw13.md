## 1. List and Explain All of the New Learned Annotations

- **@Test**: Used to specify a test method that JUnit will execute.
- **@BeforeEach**: Runs before each test method to perform setup.
- **@AfterEach**: Runs after each test method to perform cleanup.
- **@BeforeAll**: Runs once before any test methods in the class, typically used for setup at a class level.
- **@AfterAll**: Runs once after all test methods in the class have run, typically used for cleanup at a class level.
- **@Disabled**: Marks a test method or class as disabled, meaning it will not be executed.
- **@ParameterizedTest**: Used for writing parameterized tests, where the same test is run multiple times with different inputs.
- **@Mock**: Creates and injects mock objects.
- **@InjectMocks**: Injects mock objects into the object being tested.
- **@Spy**: Partially mocks an object, allowing some methods to be real and others to be mocked.
- **@Captor**: Captures argument values for further assertions in the test methods.

## 2. What is the Lifecycle of JUnit?

The lifecycle of JUnit tests follows these steps:
1. **@BeforeAll**: Runs once before all tests, typically for expensive setup (like database connection).
2. **@BeforeEach**: Runs before each individual test, resetting the environment for the next test.
3. **@Test**: The actual test method, where assertions are made to validate behavior.
4. **@AfterEach**: Runs after each test method to clean up or reset states.
5. **@AfterAll**: Runs once after all tests are completed, typically for cleanup tasks.

## 3. Explain Parameterized Testing

Parameterized testing allows for a single test method to be run multiple times with different parameters. JUnit's `@ParameterizedTest` annotation, combined with a source of parameters (e.g., `@ValueSource`, `@CsvSource`, or `@MethodSource`), allows you to run the same logic with various inputs. This is useful for testing the same logic under different conditions without duplicating code.

## 4. Explain Mockito and PowerMock

- **Mockito**: A popular mocking framework for unit testing in Java. It allows you to create mock objects, specify behavior, and verify interactions in tests without the need for actual implementations.
- **PowerMock**: An extension of Mockito that supports mocking static methods, final classes, constructors, and private methods, which Mockito cannot handle by default.

## 5. Compare @Mock and @InjectMock

- **@Mock**: Creates a mock instance of a class or interface. This mock object is a placeholder for testing, allowing you to define expected behavior without using the real implementation.
- **@InjectMocks**: Creates an instance of the class under test and automatically injects any mocks marked with `@Mock` into the instance.

## 6. Explain Stubbing

Stubbing is a process in unit testing where you define the behavior of a mock object. For example, you can use Mockitoâ€™s `when().thenReturn()` syntax to specify that when a method on a mock object is called, it should return a certain value. This allows the test to control the behavior of dependencies in the system.

## 7. What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?

Mockito's `ArgumentMatchers` allows you to specify flexible or generic conditions for matching arguments in stubbing or verification. For example, instead of checking for an exact value, you can use matchers like `any()`, `eq()`, or `anyString()` to handle broader cases.

Example:
```java
when(mockObject.someMethod(anyString())).thenReturn("mocked response");
```

## 8. What is Hamcrest Matchers?

Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, which are used in unit tests to perform flexible and readable assertions. Common matchers include `equalTo()`, `containsString()`, `hasItems()`, and `is()`, among others.

Example:
```java
assertThat(value, is(equalTo(expectedValue)));
```

## 9. Compare @Spy and @Mock

- **@Mock**: Creates a completely mocked instance of a class or interface, meaning all methods are mocked and you need to define their behavior.
- **@Spy**: Partially mocks an instance. Real methods are called unless explicitly stubbed. This is useful when you want to mock part of the behavior but still rely on the real object for some methods.

## 10. Explain Assertion

Assertions are used to verify the expected result in a unit test. JUnit provides various methods such as:
- `assertEquals(expected, actual)`: Asserts that two values are equal.
- `assertTrue(condition)`: Asserts that a condition is true.
- `assertNotNull(object)`: Asserts that an object is not `null`.

Assertions ensure that the code behaves as expected and will fail the test if the conditions aren't met.
