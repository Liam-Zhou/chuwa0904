## 1. Annotations

## 2. Lifecycle of Junit

- Test class initialize @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach executed  before @Test. 
- Test method execution. 
- Clean up happen at method level @AfterEach and class level @AfterAll
- ![Test lifecycle](https://howtodoinjava.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/JUnit-Test-Life-Cycle-1.jpg)

## 3. Parameterized testing

In Junit, it allows to run the same test multiple times with different parameters. 

Achieved bye of a Parameterized Test

- **`@ParameterizedTest`**: This annotation marks a method as a parameterized test.

- **`@ValueSource`** (or other parameter sources): Specifies the different inputs that will be used to invoke the test method.

- **`@CsvSource`**: For comma-separated values (multiple parameters per test case).
- **`@CsvFileSource`**: For loading CSV data from a file.
- **`@MethodSource`**: For providing complex objects or values using a method.
- **`@EnumSource`**: For testing with enum values.

## 4. Explain Mockito and PowerMock

Mockito relies heavily on Java reflection to create mock objects and manipulate them at runtime. It is useful for isolating class and its dependencies, making it easier to **focus on specific behaviors**. It has limitation mock static, final methods, private and constructors.

**Features**:

- Creating mock objects.
- Defining the behavior of mock methods.
- Verifying interactions with mocks.
- Spying on real objects to monitor their interactions

~~~java
class ClassUnderTest {
    private Dependency dependency;

    public ClassUnderTest(Dependency dependency) {
        this.dependency = dependency;
    }

    public String methodUnderTest() {
        return dependency.getValue();
    }
}

@Mock
private Dependency dependency;

@InjectMocks
private ClassUnderTest classUnderTest;

@Test
void testMethod() {
    //dependency.method() real implementation will not be called, instead, it returns a predefined value.
    when(dependency.getValue()).thenReturn("Mocked Value");
    String result = classUnderTest.methodUnderTest();
    assertEquals("Mocked Value", result);
}
~~~

**PowerMock**

It is a extension to Mockito and EasyMock. Provides additional features that do not support by Mockito.

Mock static methods:

~~~java
@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
@PrepareForTest(ClassWithStaticMethods.class)
public class PowerMockExampleTest {

    @Test
    public void testStaticMethod() {
        PowerMockito.mockStatic(ClassWithStaticMethods.class);
        when(ClassWithStaticMethods.staticMethod()).thenReturn("Mocked Value");
        
        String result = ClassUnderTest.callStaticMethod();
        assertEquals("Mocked Value", result);
    }
}
~~~



"Spring Boot test **requires** Mockito"?

- **No**, Mockito is not required for Spring Boot tests. Spring Boot testing can be done using other mocking frameworks or even without mocking. However, Mockito is highly popular because it simplifies testing by allowing you to mock Spring beans and services.

"PowerMock is an extension of Mockito, mainly focused on static method tests"?

- **Partially correct**. PowerMock is indeed an extension, but not only for Mockito. It can also extend other frameworks like EasyMock. PowerMock is mainly used for mocking static methods, final classes, private methods, and constructors, which are areas where Mockito traditionally struggled, especially before Mockito 3.x.

## 5. Compare @Mock and @InjectMock

Purpose: **@Mock** is used to create and inject a mock object/instance for a class or an interface. 

Usage: To simulate the behavior of dependencies in the class under test.

~~~java
@Mock
private Dependency dependency;
// This will create a mock instance of Dependency, which you can then customize with behaviors (using when, thenReturn, etc.) and verify interactions with.
~~~



**@InjectMock** automatically inject mock objects (those annotated with @Mock or created manually with Mockito.mock()) into the class under  test. This helps instantiate the class you want to test (also called the "system under test" or SUT).

~~~java
// ClassUnderTest is instantiated, and Dependency is automatically injected into it.
@InjectMocks
private ClassUnderTest classUnderTest;

@Mock
private Dependency dependency;

~~~



## 6. Explain stubbing

Concept in testing where you define the behavior of a mock object for specific method calls. 

We specify what the mock should return or do when the method is invoked.

Mainly to isolate the system from its dependencies.

~~~java
// Create a mock object of the Dependency class
Dependency dependency = mock(Dependency.class);
// Stubbing: Define the behavior of the mock
when(dependency.getValue()).thenReturn("Stubbed Value");
~~~



## 7. What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

In a word, dynamically specify the matched method to test. For reusability

~~~java
// Stub the method with ArgumentMatchers
when(myMock.method(anyInt())).thenReturn("Any Integer");
when(myMock.method(eq(5))).thenReturn("Specific Value");
// Assertions
assertEquals("Any Integer", myMock.method(10));  // anyInt() matches 10
assertEquals("Specific Value", myMock.method(5)); // eq(5) matches 5 exactly
~~~

~~~java
@Test
public void testWithCustomMatcher() {
    MyClass myMock = mock(MyClass.class);

    // Using a custom matcher for argument matching
    when(myMock.method(argThat(num -> num > 10))).thenReturn("Greater than 10");

    // Assertions
    assertEquals("Greater than 10", myMock.method(15));
    assertNull(myMock.method(5)); // 5 doesn't match the condition, so returns default (null)
}
~~~



## 8. What is Hamcrest Matchers

Popular framwork in Java for writing expressive and flexible unit test assertions. 

~~~java
assertThat(value, is(5)); // Similar to assertEquals(5, value)
assertThat(value, equalTo(5));
assertThat(value, not(5));
assertThat(value, nullValue());       // Checks for null
assertThat(value, notNullValue());    // Checks for not nullassertThat(value, 
assertThat(value, lessThan(20));
assertThat(value, greaterThan(10));
assertThat("hello world", containsString("hello"));
assertThat("hello world", startsWith("hello"));
assertThat("hello world", endsWith("world"));
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
assertThat(list, hasItem("banana"));           // Checks if list contains "banana"
assertThat(list, hasItems("banana", "cherry")); // Checks for multiple items
assertThat(value, instanceOf(String.class));
~~~



## 9. Compare @Spy and @Mock

**@Mock** creates mock objects that simulates the behavior of a real object by defaulting all method calls to return default value. The behavior can be defined using **stubbing**.

By default all method are mocked, they do not call the actual implementation. They return the default value unless stubbed.

**@Spy**: create a spy object that is partial mock of the real object. It allows to call the **real methods** while also able to **stub specific methods** to return different values.



## 10. Assertion

 Assertion is simple as we assert the expected value
