# HW16 Testing II

## Explain the following concept

### 1. Docker daemon

The server-side component of the Docker Engine that runs as a background process on the host system. It is resposible for creating, managing, and orchestrating containers.

### 2. Docker Host

The machine (physical or virtual) where Docker Daemon runs and containers are executed.

### 3. Docker registry

Docker registr is a location where we can store and distribute Docker images.

### 4. Image/Image Tag

Image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package containing everything needed to run software (code, runtime, libraries).  
Tags are used to identify different versions or variations of an image.

### 5. Container

Docker container can be loaded with different types of software applications, such as web servers, databases, and microservices, without affecting the deployment process

### 6. Volume

Docker volume is a mechanism for persisting and managing data generated by user or by Docker containers. It allows you to separate the data from the container's lifecycle, enabling you to persist data even after the container has been stopped or removed. Docker volumes are useful for sharing data between containers and for storing data that must be retained across container restarts.

### 7. Docker namespace vs Kubernetes Namespace

Docker Namespace: Isolates resources (like processes, network) within containers.  
Kubernetes Namespace: Logical partition to separate resources within a Kubernetes cluster.

### 8. Kubernetes Node

A physical or virtual machine that runs containerized applications. It hosts Pods.

### 9. Kubernetes Pod

The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, which can contain one or more tightly coupled containers.

### 10. Kubernetes Service

Exposes a group of Pods over a stable IP address, allowing communication between components.

### 11. Kubernetes ReplicaSet

Ensures that a specified number of replicas (identical Pods) are running at all times.

### 12. Kubernetes Deployment

Manages the lifecycle of ReplicaSets, including scaling and rolling updates for Pods.
