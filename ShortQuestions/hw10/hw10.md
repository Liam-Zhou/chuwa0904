### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from this class session.

See code. 

### 2. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?



### 3. What is MVC pattern?

MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns.  

Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.  

View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.  

Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view 
whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.  

### 4. What is Front-Controller?

The front controller maps the incoming request to a controller

### 5. Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works.

DispatcherServlet abstracts away the following tedious and boilerplate tasks:  
1. Mapping an HTTP request to a certain processing method  
2. Parsing of HTTP request data and headers into data transfer objects (DTOs)or domain objects  
3. Model-view-controller interaction  
4. Generation of responses from DTOs, domain objects, etc.  

### 6. What is JSP and What is Model And View？

In Java, JSP stands for Jakarta Server Pages( (JSP; formerly JavaServer Pages)). It is a server-side technology that is 
used for creating web applications. It is used to create dynamic web content. JSP consists of both HTML tags and JSP 
tags. In this, JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology 
i.e. a web-based technology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java code can 
be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by the JSP container before processing the 
client’s request. JSP has various features like JSP Expressions, JSP tags, JSP Expression Language, etc.

### 7. Explain servlet and servlet container , name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat
#### Servlet
A Servlet is a Java class that extends the capabilities of servers, often used to handle requests and generate dynamic 
web content. It is part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform, specifically designed for web-based applications. 
Servlets run on the server side and typically respond to HTTP requests, though they can also handle other types of requests.

Key responsibilities of a servlet include:  

Processing client requests (such as form submissions).  
Generating dynamic content (like HTML, JSON, or XML).  
Managing sessions and cookies.  
Redirecting or forwarding requests to other servlets or web resources.  

#### Servlet Container
A Servlet Container (also known as a web container) is a part of a web server or application server that manages and 
executes servlets. It provides the runtime environment for servlets and handles the lifecycle of servlets, including:

Loading and initializing the servlet.  
Managing requests and responses between clients and servlets.  
Ensuring proper threading and concurrency.  
Handling configuration and deployment details.  
Offering services like session management, security, and logging.  

#### Examples of Servlet Implementations:
Servlet implementations typically conform to the Jakarta Servlet API (formerly Java Servlet API). Some well-known implementations include:

Apache Tomcat (most widely used)
Jetty (from Eclipse Foundation)
GlassFish (by Oracle, open-source implementation of Java EE)
WildFly (formerly known as JBoss, a full Java EE application server)
Resin (a commercial application server by Caucho)


### 8. clone this repo, and run it on you local,
1. https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo
2. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself.
3. find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.
4. remeber to setup mysql database for this project
5. Test APIs (controllers) in postman
