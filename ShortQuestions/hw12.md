### Question 3
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.
Concepts of AOP:
* Aspect: A module that encapsulates the behavior affecting multiple classes, where we use following annotations to define pointcuts and apply advices.
* Join Point: A joinpoint is a candidate point in the Program Execution of the application where an aspect can be plugged in.
* Pointcut: A pointcut defines at what joinpoints, the associated Advice should be applied.
* Advice: before/after/around/afterThrowing - When to execute aop methods when the application pointcut is found.

### Question 4
* Advantages
  * Spring AOP allows you to modularize cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security, or transaction management) in separate aspects. This keeps your coding logic clean and focused on its core functionality, improving code readability and maintainability.
  * Since aspects are defined in one place and applied globally, any changes to cross-cutting concerns can be made in a single location, making updates and refactoring more straightforward.
* Disadvatages
  * Spring AOP primarily focused on method-level join points. It does not support field-level or constructor-level join points as fully as AspectJ does, which can limit some advanced use cases.
  * Debugging applications that use AOP can sometimes be more challenging. Since the advice code is executed "behind the scenes," it can make it harder to trace the flow of execution or understand where and when an aspect is being applied.
### Question 5
1. Aspect: An aspect is a class that defines what and where the cross-cutting functionality should be applied.
  ```
  @Aspect
  @Component
  @Order(2)
  public class LoggingAspect {

    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass());

    ....
  }
  ```
2. Pointcut: A Pointcut is an expression that defines where an aspect should be applied in the application.
   ```
    @Pointcut("execution(public * org.example.springsecuritydemo.*.*(..))")
    private void publicMethodsFromLoggingPackage() {}
   ```
3. JoinPoint: A JoinPoint represents a specific point in the execution of the program, like when a method is called or when an exception is thrown.
  ```
  @Before(value = "publicMethodsFromLoggingPackage()")
  ```
4. Advice: An Advice is the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. It defines what should be done when the pointcut is matched. Different types of advice include:
  ```
  public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
      logger.info("Logging before method execution.");
  }
  ```


### Question 6
Pointcuts are usually declared using the **@Pointcut** annotation. But, we can declare pointcuts directly in the advice annotations without using an empty method. For example, we can define a pointcut expression in the @Before, @After, or @Around annotations directly.

### Question 7
* @Before advice runs before the actual method (join point) execution.
* @After advice runs after the method execution, regardless of whether the method completed successfully or threw an exception
* @AfterReturning advice runs after the method successfully returns a result.
* @Around advice surrounds the method execution. It can control both before and after the method execution and has the ability to modify the return value or prevent the method from executing.
