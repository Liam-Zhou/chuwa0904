## 3. What is AOP

【史上最完整的AOP底层原理】https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1SY41117zq?vd_source=70fe48a26aee4074fba8b72a896867e9

**AOP**: Aspect orient programming, a programming concept. Separate the cross-cutting concerns from the main business logic of application. 

It helps modularize concerns like logging, transaction management, or security, which tend to span multiple parts of an application. With AOP, these functionalities can be separated out, making the main codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.



## 4. What are pros and cons of AOP

Pros: 

- Separation of Concerns
- Modularity, Reduce code duplication

Cons:

- Reduced readability
- Overhead and performance cost of proxy layer
- AOP mainly support method-level join points



## 5. Explain concept in own words

### Imagine a Coffee Shop:

In a coffee shop, the main job is making coffee. But there are other repetitive tasks too, like cleaning up after a customer, logging sales, or checking inventory. These extra tasks are similar to “cross-cutting concerns” in programming because they don’t directly involve making coffee but are still essential. 

In Spring AOP, we can set up these additional tasks separately and automatically apply them wherever they’re needed.

- **Aspect**(Helper role): Aspect is a class where we define what these helpers do.

  Think of an *Aspect* as a specialized helper role, like a janitor or a cashier. This role handles tasks that don’t belong directly to coffee-making but are important for running the coffee shop. 

  

- **PointCut** (Which join points to apply advice): An expression that matches join points.

  A *Pointcut* is like setting up rules to decide where your helpers should step in. For instance, you may decide the janitor only cleans tables after customers with kids or the cashier only greets regulars. In Spring, Pointcuts are expressions that specify which join points should trigger advice.

  

- **JoinPoint** (Trigger point): A *Join Point* is any event in the coffee-making process where you might need an extra helper. For example, you might need the janitor after every customer leaves, or the cashier each time someone pays. In Spring, Join Points are often method calls where these extra tasks (like logging or cleaning up) are inserted.

  

- **Advice** (Action at the trigger point): The action taken by an aspect at a specific joint point. 

  - **Before advice**: Runs before something happens. For instance, a barista might check inventory before making coffee.
  - **After returning advice**: Runs after a task is successfully completed, like cleaning up after a customer leaves.
  - **After throwing advice**: Runs if something goes wrong, such as an apology or discount if a customer spills their drink.
  - **Around advice**: Runs before and after an event, like a cashier’s process of greeting, taking payment, and saying goodbye.

  

## 6. How do we declare pointcut, can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some expressions to do it.

A pointcut expression can be directly used within an aspect to specify where advice should apply, and it can be referenced within advice annotations like `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around`, etc.

~~~java
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {
    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBeforeMethod() {
        System.out.println("A method is being called in the service package.");
    }
}
~~~



`Execution` 

- Used to match method executions.

- Example: `execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))`
  - Matches any method in any class within `com.example.service`, regardless of the method name or arguments.

**`within`**:

- Used to match all methods in a specified package or class.

- Example: 

  ```
  within(com.example.service..*)
  ```

  - Matches all classes and methods within the `com.example.service` package, including sub-packages.

**`this`**:

- Used to match join points where the bean reference is an instance of the specified type.

- Example: 

  ```
  this(com.example.service.CustomerService)
  ```

  - Matches all methods on beans that implement `CustomerService`.

**`target`**:

- Similar to `this`, but matches based on the target object type rather than the proxy.

- Example: 

  ```
  target(com.example.service.CustomerService)
  ```

  - Matches all methods on target objects of `CustomerService`, regardless of the proxy interface.

**`args`**:

- Matches methods with specific parameter types.

- Example: 

  ```
  args(java.lang.String, ..)
  ```

  - Matches methods with a `String` parameter as the first argument, followed by any number of other arguments.

**`@annotation`**:

- Matches methods annotated with a specific annotation.

- Example: 

  ```
  @annotation(org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional)
  ```

  - Matches methods annotated with `@Transactional`.

**`@within`**:

- Matches all methods in classes annotated with a specified annotation.

- Example: 

  ```
  @within(org.springframework.stereotype.Service)
  ```

  - Matches all methods in classes annotated with `@Service`.

**`@target`**:

- Similar to `@within`, but matches join points where the target object has a specific annotation.

- Example: 

  ```
  @target(org.springframework.stereotype.Service)
  ```

  - Matches methods on any target object annotated with `@Service`.

## 7. Compare different types of advices in Spring AOP

Before Advice

- Runs before method execution

After returning Advice

- Runs after a method returns successfully

After throwing Advice

- Runs if the method throw an exception

After(Finally) Advice

- Runs after the method execution completes, regardless of its outcome (whether successful or with an exception).

Around Advice

- Runs before and after the execution and has full control over whether the method executes at all.

### Summary Comparison Table

| Advice Type         | Executes Timing          | Can Modify Method Execution | Best For                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Before**          | Before method            | No                          | Logging, authorization, setup tasks                          |
| **After Returning** | After successful return  | No                          | Post-processing after successful completion                  |
| **After Throwing**  | After an exception       | No                          | Exception handling, logging errors                           |
| **After (Finally)** | Always after completion  | No                          | Cleanup, resource release                                    |
| **Around**          | Before & after, can skip | Yes                         | Transaction management, performance monitoring, altering method behavior |
