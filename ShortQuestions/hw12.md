# HW12: Spring AOP Assignment

## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework

Please see [annotation.md](./annotations.md).

## 2. Briefly read: [TechGeekNext: Spring AOP Interview Questions](https://www.techgeeknext.com/spring-boot/spring-aop-interview-questions)
This link provides a collection of common interview questions for Spring AOP, helping you solidify your understanding of the core concepts such as cross-cutting concerns, joinpoints, pointcuts, and types of advice.

## 3. What is Aspect-Oriented Programming? Explain it with detailed use cases.

**Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** is a programming paradigm that separates cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security, and transaction management) from the main business logic. 

### Use Case:
Imagine a web application where you want to log every request that comes into the system. Instead of writing logging logic in every method that handles the request, AOP allows you to write this once in an aspect and apply it across the application wherever needed.

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {
    
    @Before("execution(* com.example..*(..))")
    public void logBeforeMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Executing method: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
    }
    
    @After("execution(* com.example..*(..))")
    public void logAfterMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Method executed: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
    }
}
```

This aspect will apply to all methods and log when a method is about to execute and after it completes execution.

## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

**Advantages:**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Cross-cutting logic is centralized, keeping business logic clean.
- **Reusability:** Common logic can be reused across multiple classes.
- **Maintainability:** Makes the code more maintainable as cross-cutting logic is managed in one place.
- **Modularity:** Improves modularization by encapsulating concerns into separate aspects.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity:** It can make the program harder to understand due to separation between business logic and cross-cutting concerns.
- **Performance Overhead:** AOP adds some overhead due to proxies and reflection.
- **Debugging Challenges:** Since AOP adds behavior dynamically, it can be harder to trace the flow of execution during debugging.

## 5. Explain the following concepts in your own words:

1. **Aspect**:
   An aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes or methods, like logging or security. It defines what the cross-cutting concern is and how/when it should be applied.

2. **PointCut**:
   A PointCut is an expression that defines the joinpoints (places in the code) where an aspectâ€™s advice should be applied.

3. **JoinPoint**:
   A JoinPoint is a point during the execution of a program, such as method invocation or exception handling, where an aspect can be applied.

4. **Advice**:
   Advice is the action taken by an aspect at a specific joinpoint, such as running a piece of code before or after a method execution.

## 6. How do we declare a pointcut? Can we declare it without annotating an empty method?

We declare a pointcut using the `@Pointcut` annotation. It is possible to bind pointcuts without using empty methods by directly annotating the advice with the pointcut expression.

Example:

```java
@Around("execution(* com.example..*(..))")
public Object logAround(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
    // logging logic here
    return joinPoint.proceed();
}
```

This eliminates the need for a separate method with `@Pointcut`.

## 7. Compare different types of advices in Spring AOP:

- **@Before**: Runs before the joinpoint method is executed.
- **@After**: Runs after the method, regardless of the outcome.
- **@AfterReturning**: Runs after a method successfully returns a result.
- **@AfterThrowing**: Runs if the method throws an exception.
- **@Around**: Combines all types of advice and provides full control over the method execution.

## 8. On top of your Spring application which you did in Assignment #11:

1. Implement a customized logger using Spring AOP, your logger should be able to log your code and also external code.
2. Your AOP logger should log method execution time, Rest API request details and response details.
3. Your AOP logger should log with all possible joint points (before method execution, after method execution etc...).
4. You should bind jointPoints with your AOP code directly, instead of binding it with an empty method.
5. Be ready to demo your implementation and prove it works in class.
