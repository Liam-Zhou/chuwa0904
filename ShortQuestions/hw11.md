## HW11
### Question 2
* SSL/TLS: TLS is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. It is the successor of SSL
* PKI: It is a framework for creating, managing, distributing, using, storing, and revoking digital certificates and public-private key pairs. 
* Certificate: A certificate is a digital document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an entity’s identity. Certificates are issued by trusted third-party Certificate Authorities (CAs) and provide proof that the public key contained in the certificate belongs to the entity.
  * A typical certificate includes:
        * Subject: The entity to whom the certificate is issued.
        * Public Key: The public key associated with the entity.
        * Issuer: The Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate.
        * Validity Period: The start and end dates during which the certificate is valid.
        * Signature: A digital signature from the CA that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate.
  
* Public Key: A public key is one half of a cryptographic key pair used in asymmetric encryption. It is used for encryption and can be shared publicly. The public key is usually embedded in a digital certificate and is used to encrypt data and verify digital signatures.
* Private Key: A private key is the other half of the cryptographic key pair used in asymmetric encryption. It must be kept secure and is never shared with others. The private key is used to decrypt data and create digital signatures.
* Signature: A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of a message or document. It proves that the message was created by the claimed sender (authentication) and that the message has not been altered (integrity).
    * Here's how it works:
      * The sender creates a hash (a fixed-size unique representation) of the message.
      * The sender encrypts this hash with their private key, creating the digital signature.
      * The recipient, who has the sender’s public key, can decrypt the signature and compare the result to the hash of the message.
      * If they match, the recipient knows the message is authentic and unchanged.
      * If they don't match, it means either the message has been tampered with, or the sender is not who they claim to be.

### Question 4
1. 401 Unauthorized: The client is not authenticated, meaning the request requires user authentication, and the user’s credentials are either missing or invalid.
2. 403 Forbidden: The client is authenticated but does not have permission to access the requested resource. The server understands the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
3. 419 Authentication Timeout: The authentication process has timed out, typically due to a session expiring.
4. 429 Too Many Requests: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time, often related to authentication attempts.
5. 498 Invalid Token: An invalid or expired token was provided.

### Question 5
1: Authentication
  * Authentication verifies the identity of a user
  * Authentication is based on credentials (e.g., username, password)
  * Authentication is the fHappens after authenticationirst step of security
2: Authorization
  * Authorization focuses on determining what actions an authenticated user can perform.
  * Authorization is based on permissions or roles.
  * Authorization happens after authentication
  
### Question 6
An HTTP session is a way to maintain state between the client (e.g., a web browser) and the server over multiple requests. Each HTTP request is independent，the server has no memory of previous requests without a session. Sessions allow the server to recognize a user across multiple interactions.
To keep track of a session, the server assigns a unique session ID to each client. This ID is used to identify and retrieve the session on subsequent requests.
The session ID is typically stored in a cookie or sometimes passed as a URL parameter or in hidden form fields.
Here’s a typical flow of how an HTTP session is managed:
* Client Request:
  * When a user visits a website, the browser sends a request to the server.
* Session Creation:
  * The server checks if there is an existing session associated with the request by looking for a session ID in the request from a cookie.
  * If no session exists, the server creates a new session and generates a unique session ID. The server sends a Set-Cookie header containing the session ID. The browser stores this session ID in a cookie
* Session Storage:
  * The server stores data associated with the session in a server-side storage (like in memory, a database, or a distributed cache).
  * The session ID is sent back to the client in the response stored in a cookie.
* Subsequent Requests:
  * For subsequent requests, the browser automatically includes the session ID from the cookie in the request headers.
  * The server retrieves the session data using the session ID and uses it to respond appropriately.
* Session Termination:
  * The session is either explicitly terminated when the user logs out or ends after a period of inactivity (session timeout).

### Question 7 
A cookie consists of key-value pairs of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser stores this data locally on the user's device and sends it back to the server with each subsequent request. Cookies are used to maintain state in stateless HTTP connections.
Detailed interaction between cookies and session is in Question 6

### Question 8
* Session:
  * The data is stored server-side, meaning all session data resides on the web server. The client typically only holds the session ID that stored in a cookie to reference the session data on the server.
* Cookie:
  * Cookies are stored client-side, meaning the data is saved directly in the user's browser. Cookies are sent with every request to the server for the specific domain.

### Question 10
As mentioned above, sessions store the user data on the server-side that have a session id. The client storing only a session ID in a cookie to link back to the server’s session data.

### Question 11
The Spring Security filter intercepts HTTP requests and responses and applies security mechanisms before they reach the controller or after they leave it. The Spring Security filters are used to enforce security policies, such as authentication, authorization.

### Question 12
A bearer token is an access token that allows users to access protected resources or services by presenting the token to the server.
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a type of bearer token and is widely used for stateless authentication. It is a compact, self-contained token that encodes JSON data
The structure of JWT consist of:
* Header: The header contains metadata about the token, including the algorithm used to generate the signature.
* Payload: The payload contains claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. 
* Signature: The signature is used to verify that the token has not been altered.
* 
### Question 13
* Using sessive for authentication, store all the sensitive data in server side.
* Cookies can be marked by attributes like "Secure" d "HttpOnly" to
prevent unauthorized access 
* Hash passwords using BCrypt or another secure hashing algorithm before storing them in the database. Never store passwords in plaintext.
* use tokenization or encryption (such as AES-256) to store sensitive data securely in the database.

### Question 14
* UserDetailsService: Retrieves user details from a data source.
* AuthenticationProvider: Validates the user's credentials.
* AuthenticationManager: Manages the authentication process by delegating to one or more.
* AuthenticationFilter: Intercepts HTTP requests to trigger the authentication process

### Question 15
* Scalability： When the number of users increases, and the server has to maintain session data for every active user. It will become hard to maintain. So instead of storing sessions in the memory of a single server, store session data in a centralized or distributed session store such as Redis, Memcached, or a database.
* Security Risks: Since session IDs are often stored in cookies, an attacker can steal a user’s session ID and impersonate them. If session data is not transmitted securely (over HTTP instead of HTTPS), it can be intercepted by an attacker. Use secure HTTPS connection in sessions transmition can prevent session hijacking.

### Question 16
@Value Annotation: Injecting individual properties directly into your configuration or service classes.
@ConfigurationProperties: For binding groups of related properties into a structured class, making it easier to manage complex configurations.

### Question 17
* configure(HttpSecurity http): Used to configure HTTP-level security, such as access control for specific URLs, CSRF protection, session management, form login, and more.
* configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): Used to configure authentication mechanisms, such as how users should be authenticated (in-memory, database, LDAP, etc.), and how the AuthenticationManager is set up.
