## 2. Explain TLS, PKI, certificate, public key, private key and signature

**TLS**(Transport Layer Security) is the modern **SSL**(Secure Sockets Layer), public and private key for data encryption.

**PKI**(Public Key Infrastructure): Basically the **Technical Protocol used by TLS**.  A system manages public keys and digital certificates to enable secure communication and authentication over a network. It is crucial for enabling trusted communication in TLS.

 - How it works
   - Public and Private Keys
   - Certificate contains the public key, along with identity information (e.g. the owner of a domain). the CA's signature, and the certificate's **expiration** date.
   - Chain of Trust: The certificate's authenticity is validated using a chain of trust. The client trust the root CA. which then validates the intermediate CAs and eventually the server certificate itself.

**JWT** is a safe way to share data using JSON. 

- Header: {"alg": "HS256", "type": "JWT"}, algorithm and key type
- Payload: Carry custom information like id, username
- **Signature**: is used to verify the authenticity. It is calculated using the algorithm defined in header. Using header, payload, and its **private** key as seed to create a signature. 

**Certificate** **证书颁发机构（CA, Certificate Authority）** 签发 证书颁发机构是一个可信的第三方组织，它负责验证实体（如个人、公司、服务器）的身份，并为其签发数字证书。主要用于 **身份验证** 和 **加密密钥的安全交换**。

- 服务器身份验证：当用户尝试访问一个通过https加密的服务器时 服务器发送一个证书包含公钥服务器域名的星系
- 浏览器会检查这个证书合法性 验证成功后 会认为服务器是可信的

**Public key and private key**: are generated in pairs and used in SSL/TLS. Server has both of them and server send the public key to client, both server and client will encrypt and decrypt data using the public key.

## 3. Write a Spring based app

In Coding folder.

## 4. List all http status code related to authentication and authorization

401 Unauthorized: Failed or not provided (**Authentication Fail**)

403 Forbidden: Succeeded but access is not allowed (**Authorization Fail**)

407 Proxy Authentication Required: Authentication is required by a proxy

419 Authentication Timeout (Unofficial/Non-standard): Timeout due to inactivity

451 Unavailable for Legal Reasons: Access restricted due to legal reasons



## 5. Compare `Authentication` and `Authorization`, Name and Explain components under them

The order is send request -> Authentication -> Authorization. 

The first Authentication checks whether there exist a authenticated user.

Then it checks the user identity to see its permission. (root, user)



## 6. Explain HTTP Session

Http session is to maintain state between client and server across multiple http request. It is crucial because http is stateless protocol. With session, it helps server to recognize the client across multiple requests, creating "conversations" between them.

- Initialize the session: (for example, logging in), server creates a session to keep track of the user state. The session is identified by a unique session ID.

- Session ID transmission

- Maintaining State

- Session Data

- Ending Session

  

## 7. Explain Cookie

It is key-value pair data stored in client machine in. Browser can automatically use the key information in cookie. It normally maintains the login sessions, user preferences or track user behavior.

After a user logs into a website, the server generates a session cookie stored in user's browser. The cookie contains a unique **session identifier**, which the server uses to recognize the user. 

### **Difference Between JWT and Cookies**

While **JWT (JSON Web Token)** and **Cookies** are both used for authentication, they operate differently:

- **JWT** is a self-contained token that includes the user's identity and a signature, which the server can verify to ensure its integrity.
- **Cookies** are more like a storage mechanism. They can store session identifiers, JWTs, or other data. Even when using JWT for authentication, it can still be stored inside a cookie.

## 8. Compare Session and Cookie

**Session** is a stateful reference sent by server. 

- Session data, contains the user information and session details, is stored at the server. Session ID is just a pointer to the data.
- Client only get the session ID, usually stores in the cookie. But the actual session data is kept on the server. When the client makes a request, the session ID is sent, the server uses it to retrieve the session data.

**Cookie** is multiple key-value data stored locally.

### Key Differences Between Session ID and JWT Signature:

| Feature          | Session ID                                               | JWT Signature                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **State**        | Stateful (session data is stored on server)              | Stateless (session data is in the token)                     |
| **Storage**      | Session ID stored in cookies                             | JWT stored in cookies, local storage, or sent in headers     |
| **Data Storage** | Session data is stored on the server                     | Session data is contained in the JWT payload                 |
| **Validation**   | Server looks up session data using the ID                | Server validates JWT by checking the signature               |
| **Security**     | Session ID is just a reference; secured via HTTPS, etc.  | JWT signature ensures token integrity, preventing tampering  |
| **Scalability**  | Less scalable (server needs to track sessions)           | More scalable (no server-side session tracking)              |
| **Expiration**   | Managed server-side (sessions expire by server policies) | JWT typically has an expiry time embedded in the token itself |
| **Integrity**    | Integrity is implicit via session management             | Signature ensures integrity of the data                      |

## 9. Find at least TWO websites who can be logged in using your Google Account

Explain in detail on how Google SSO works with screenshots like below, find SSO-related Rest calls in Chrome developer tool:

**SSO (Single sing-on)** allows a user to log into a third party websites or applications using their google account credentials, without needing to create a separate account for each site or service.

## 10. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?

The **server creates a session** for the user and sends a **session ID** to the user's browser as a reference.

The **browser stores the session ID** in a cookie, which helps the client quickly resume their session without needing to log in again.

Every time the **browser sends a request**, the request automatically includes the **session ID** (from the cookie), allowing the server to quickly identify the user and retrieve their session data.



## 11. What is Spring Security Filter

It is a component that intercepts HTTP requests and processes them before they reach controller. These filters handle various tasks such as **authentication**, **authorization** and **session management**, **CSRF protection**, **Remember-me function**. Spring Security filters play a key role in securing web applications by processing the request/response at a low level.

可以自定义各种filters

**`UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`**

**`BasicAuthenticationFilter`**

**`SecurityContextPersistenceFilter`**

**`ExceptionTranslationFilter`**

**`FilterSecurityInterceptor`**

**`CsrfFilter`**

**`LogoutFilter`**

**`RememberMeAuthenticationFilter`**

## 12. Explain Bearer token and how JWT works

Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) 是一个general concept，微服务架构中，负责生成、管理和分发 Bearer Token 的服务通常被称为 授权服务器（Authorization Server） 

JWT token是具体实现 三段内容用JSON存储 并用BASE64编码：

- Header: {"alg": "HS256", "type": "JWT"}, algorithm and key type
- Payload: Carry custom information like id, username
- **Signature**: is used to verify the authenticity. It is calculated using the algorithm defined in header. Using header, payload, and server's **private** key as seed to create a signature.



## 13. Explain how do we store sensitive user information such as password and credit card number in DB

**For password:**

1. **Never store in plaintext**.
2. Use strong **hashing** algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
3. Add a **salt** to each password before hashing.
4. Store the hashed password and salt in the database.
5. Use **key derivation functions** designed for password storage.

**For credit card:** 

1. **Tokenization** is the preferred method for storing credit card numbers.
2. Use strong **encryption** (e.g., AES-256) if storing credit card numbers directly.
3. Comply with **PCI DSS** standards for storing, processing, and transmitting credit card data.
4. Implement strict **access control** and **auditing** for any sensitive financial data.



## 14. Compare UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationFilter

还是Spring security, authentication and authorization 的部分. 层层向下委托

| Component                  | Role/Responsibility                                          | Usage Example                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **UserDetailsService**     | Retrieves user information from a data source (e.g., database) to authenticate users. | Used for fetching user details, like username and password.  |
| **AuthenticationProvider** | Performs the actual authentication by validating user credentials. | Custom provider to check credentials and return `Authentication`. |
| **AuthenticationManager**  | Manages and coordinates the authentication process, delegating to `AuthenticationProvider`. | Manages multiple authentication methods (e.g., form, token). |
| **AuthenticationFilter**   | Intercepts HTTP requests and triggers the authentication process by passing credentials to the manager. | Extracts credentials (e.g., username, token) from HTTP requests. |



## 15. Cons of Session

1. Sever-side scalability issue. 

   1. Memory or storage issue to maintain session data. 
   2. Challenging to maintain 

2. Sticky session Stateful means data is stored on the server. This contradicts modern stateless design principles, makes difficult to scale horizontally.

3. Security risks session hijacking. Attacker tricks the user into using a known session ID, and once the user logs in, the attacker can take over their session. 

   Cross-Site Scripting(XSS): If the session ID is stored in cookies that are accessible via JavaScript, an attacker can steal the session using XSS attacks 



## 16. How to get value from application.properties in Spring security?

@Value("${reference}")



## 17. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

1. Configure(HttpSecurity http) is responsible for configuring web-based security at the HTTP request level. It defines security rules.

   - URL security
   - Form-based login or HTTP basic authentication
   - Session management
   - CSRF enable or disable
   - Authorization rules: role of users
   - Exception handling

2. AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth is to configure authentication mechanisms, such as in-memory, JDBC-based, or LDAP-based authentication.

   - In-memory eauthentication

   - JDBC authentication

   - LDAP autheication

   - Custom authentication provider
