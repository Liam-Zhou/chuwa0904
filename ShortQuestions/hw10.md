## 1. Annotation Learned

## 2. tight coupling, loose coupling and what does Spring IoC do

**Spring IoC** is basically a factory management of the spring beans. We give the object creation and management responsibility to the spring framework. 

- Dependency Injection
- Bean lifecycle management
- Configuration management
- Promoting Design Patterns

tight coupling occurs when a class or component is heavily dependent on another class. Changes in one class often requires changes in the other, making the system difficult to maintain

- Difficult to test, low flexibility, strong dependency

loose coupling is a class or dependency that is minimal dependent on other.



## 3. MVC pattern

**Controller:** front controller maps the incoming request to a controller. They also handle requests and perform marshalling/unmarshalling. The incoming request may be handled in different ways like reading from data, processing it in some way, storing data into database or retrieving from a web service, etc. Then controller places the data in the model which, simply but, is a container for the data. The controller returns the model back to the front controller. 

**Model:** is a **container of data**. It is used to transfer data from one part of Spring MVC application to another. Controller populates the model with data from a form or a database or a web service. As can be seen from the spring MVC request flow diagram, the controller passes the model to the front controller which forwards it to the view resolver. The view template displays the data in the model. 

**View:** Receives the model containing data, read and display the data. 



## 4. What is Front-Controller

Is a design pattern, provides centralized entry point for handling requests. 

It receives requests, processes them, delegates the task of handling specific requests to other components like controller. 

It **centralize** the request handling, **delegates** the actual handling to the specific controller. And **decouples** the request processing logic from the application's view and models. 



## 5. DispatcherServlet and how it works

更多看课件

**Servlet** is a small java program that runs within a web server. 

**DispatchServlet**: Acts as a front controller for handling http requests. It plays a central role in the request handling process by **coordinating** the flow of information.

- Request handling

- Controller Mapping

- Processing request

- View Resolution

- Response generation

  

- Tomcat 收到Http Request，将request交给DispatcherServlet来处理

- DispatcherServlet 拿着该req去call HandlerMapper,

- HanlerMapper将会找到对应的Controller以及对应的method，并返回给dispactherServlet

- dispatcherServlet将call该Controller对应的method，此时会触发call service, repository and database.

- 然后结果(ModelAndView)再通过Controller返回。⼀般是返回view name, ⼀个字符串，⽐如list-customers. ⽽
  数据是要set到Model 中。

- dispatcerServlet拿着view name去call view Resolver,

- View Resolver会帮助我们找到view template, ⽐如list-customers.jsp

- 此时我们有了view template, 也有了数据model，则可以call View engine去帮助我们把数据放到view templatel
  ⾥，然后转换成纯粹的HTML

- 该HTML就是前端显示的内容，最终返回给browser。

  

## 6. What is JSP and what is Model and View

**JSP** (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used for creating dynamic web content in Java-based web application. It allows developer to embed Java code directly into html pages, enable generation of dynamic content based on user input, database queries, or other factors.

**Model and View** in Model-View-Controller pattern. 

**Model**: represents the **data and business logic** of the application. It is responsible for managing the state and behavior of the application.

**View**: is responsible for displaying the data (Model). It represents the user interface and handles user interaction



## 7. Explain servlet and servlet container, name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat

**Servlet** is a small java program that runs within a web server. 

**DispatchServlet**: Acts as a front controller for handling http requests. It plays a central role in the request handling process by **coordinating** the flow of information.

Some **servlet implementations**: Jetty, GlassFish, Wildfly, WebLogic, Apache Geronimo, Payara Server

**Servlet Containers**: Spring boot, Undertow, IBM WebSphere Application Server, Oracle WebLogic Server, Tomee.
