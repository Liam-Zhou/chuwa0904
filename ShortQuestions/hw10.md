# Spring MVC Homework 10

## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from this class session.
see [annotations.md](./annotations.md)


## 2. Explain Tight Coupling vs Loose Coupling and What Does Spring IOC Do?

- **Tight Coupling:**  
  Components are highly dependent on each other. Any change in one class will likely require changes in other classes that depend on it.

- **Loose Coupling:**  
  Components are independent of each other. This allows for easier modification and testing since components are self-contained.

- **Spring IOC (Inversion of Control):**  
  Spring IOC allows for loose coupling by managing the object creation and dependencies. It reverses the flow of control from the application to the framework.

## 3. What is MVC Pattern?

- The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern divides an application into three interconnected components:
  - **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic.
  - **View:** Displays data (the user interface).
  - **Controller:** Handles the input, processes the request, and returns the response.

## 4. What is a Front-Controller?

- A **Front Controller** is a design pattern that handles all incoming requests to the web application. In Spring MVC, the `DispatcherServlet` serves as the front controller.

## 5. Explain DispatcherServlet and How It Works

- The `DispatcherServlet` is the core component in Spring MVC that handles all requests and responses. It routes requests to the appropriate controllers and returns the views based on the processed data.

## 6. What is JSP, and What is Model And View?

- **JSP (JavaServer Pages):**  
  JSP is a technology that helps to create dynamic web pages using HTML, XML, or other document types.

- **Model and View:**  
  In Spring MVC, the `Model` holds the business data, and the `View` is responsible for displaying the output to the user.

## 7. Explain Servlet and Servlet Container

- A **Servlet** is a Java class used to handle requests and responses in a web application. A **Servlet Container** manages the lifecycle of servlets and handles web requests. Examples of servlet containers are **Tomcat**, **Jetty**, etc.

## 8. Clone and Run the Spring MVC Demo

1. Clone the repository from [this link](https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo).
2. Set up Tomcat and configure it on your local environment.
3. Ensure you have MySQL configured for the project.
4. Test the APIs using Postman.
