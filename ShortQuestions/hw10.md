# HW10 --Spring MVC

## 2. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?

### Tight Coupling
- Classes are **highly dependent** on each other.
- Changes in one class often require changes in others.
- Difficult to test, maintain, and extend.

### Loose coupling
- Classes have **minimal dependencies** on each other.
- Changes in one class have little impact on others.
- Easier to test, maintain, and extend.
- Achieved using techniques like **interfaces** and **dependency injection**.
- 
### Spring IO
- Manages object creation and dependency resolution.
- Promotes **loose coupling** using **dependency injection**.
- Objects are injected at runtime, separating object creation from usage.
- Enhances testability, flexibility, and maintainability.

## 3. What is MVC pattern?

### Definition
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** is a design pattern used for developing web applications by separating concerns into three components:

    - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. Handles data retrieval, storage, and processing.

    - **View**: Responsible for displaying the data (UI). It receives data from the Model and presents it to the user.

    - **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between Model and View. It handles user input, processes it, and updates the Model or View accordingly.

### Benefits
- Promotes **separation of concerns**.
- Enhances **modularity** and **testability**.
- Simplifies maintenance and updates.

## What is Front-Controller?

### Definition
- **Front-Controller** is a design pattern used in web applications to centralize and handle incoming requests through a single entry point. It acts as a **dispatcher** that directs requests to the appropriate handlers (controllers).

### Purpose
- Provides a **centralized control** for handling requests.
- Facilitates **common functionalities** like authentication, logging, and routing.

### Example
- In the Spring MVC framework, the `DispatcherServlet` acts as the Front-Controller, intercepting all incoming requests and forwarding them to the appropriate controllers based on URL mapping.

### Benefits
- Reduces **redundancy** by handling repetitive tasks in one place.
- Simplifies the **request flow** and makes the application easier to maintain.

## 5. Explain `DispatcherServlet` and how it works.

### Definition
- **DispatcherServlet** is the core component of the Spring MVC framework. It acts as a **Front-Controller** to manage and dispatch requests to the appropriate controllers.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization**:
    - When a Spring MVC application starts, the `DispatcherServlet` is initialized and configured via `web.xml` or `Spring Boot` configurations.

2. **Request Handling**:
    - Intercepts all incoming HTTP requests mapped to it.

3. **Request Dispatching**:
    - Uses a `HandlerMapping` to identify the correct controller for the request.
    - Calls the appropriate controller's method to process the request.

4. **View Resolution**:
    - Once the controller returns a view name and model, `DispatcherServlet` uses a `ViewResolver` to render the view (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf) with the provided data.

5. **Response**:
    - Renders the view and sends the response back to the client.

### Key Components
- **HandlerMapping**: Maps the request to the appropriate controller.
- **HandlerAdapter**: Calls the correct controller method.
- **ViewResolver**: Resolves the view name to an actual view.

## 6. What is JSP and What is Model And Viewï¼Ÿ

### JSP

#### Definition
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)** is a server-side technology used for creating dynamic web pages in Java. It allows embedding Java code in HTML using special tags.

#### Key Features
- Used to create views in MVC architecture.
- Supports custom tags, expressions, and scriptlets for dynamic content generation.
- Can interact with JavaBeans and other Java components to display data.

#### Example
```jsp
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, ${name}!</h1> <!-- Displays dynamic content -->
</body>
</html>
```

### ModelAndView

#### Definition
- **ModelAndView** is a Spring MVC object that encapsulates both the **Model** (data) and the **View** (UI) in a single object.

#### Propose
- Represents the output of a controller, carrying data and the view name to be rendered.

#### Key Components
- **Model**: Contains data attributes to be passed to the view.
- **View**: Specifies the logical view name to render (e.g., home.jsp).

#### Example
```jsp
@RequestMapping("/welcome")
public ModelAndView showWelcomePage() {
    ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("welcome"); // View name is "welcome.jsp"
    mav.addObject("message", "Welcome to Spring MVC!"); // Adds data to the Model
    return mav;
}
```

## 7. Explain servlet and servlet container, name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat

### Servlet

#### Definition
- A **Servlet** is a Java class that extends the capabilities of a web server by handling HTTP requests and generating dynamic content.
- It implements the `javax.servlet.Servlet` interface and is used to process client requests, generate responses, and interact with server-side resources.

#### How It Works
1. Receives an HTTP request from the client.
2. Processes the request (e.g., interacting with databases or services).
3. Generates an HTTP response and sends it back to the client.

#### Example
```java
@WebServlet("/hello")
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        response.getWriter().println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Servlet Container

#### Definition
- A **Servlet Container** (e.g., Apache Tomcat) is a part of a web server or application server that provides the environment for running servlets.
- It manages the servlet lifecycle, mapping requests to servlets, and providing services such as security, concurrency, and session management.

#### Responsibilities
- **Request/Response Handling**: Routes HTTP requests to appropriate servlets and sends responses.
- **Servlet Lifecycle Management**: Loads, initializes, executes, and destroys servlets.
- **Security and Session Management**: Provides built-in support for handling sessions and security mechanisms.

#### Servlet Implementations
- **Apache Tomcat**: The most common implementation of a servlet container.
- **HttpServlet**: Most common servlet implementation provided by Java EE.
- **Eclipse Jetty**: A lightweight servlet container suitable for embedded applications.
- **GlassFish**: The reference implementation for the Java EE platform.
- **Boss/WildFly**: A full-fledged application server with support for servlets and other Java EE components.


## 8. clone this repo, and run it on you local,
   1. https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo
   2. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself.
   3. find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.
   4. remeber to setup mysql database for this project
   5. Test APIs (controllers) in postman
