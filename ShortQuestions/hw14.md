## Testing Related

### Unit  Testing

Test smallest testable part of an application written by developers. It can be a function, method, procedure, module and object.

The goal is to validate each unit perform as expected under different conditions, edge cases.



### Functional Testing

A black box test.

No mocking, only call external dependencies (DB, Servicess) and data.

To validate features or functions system or application work as expected



### Integration Testing

Belong to Functional Testing. It verifies how different modules/components of a system work together once they've integrated.

- Incremental Testing, Modules are integrated and test one at a time. 
  - Top-down
  - Bottom-up
- Non-Incremental Testing, all modules are integrated at once and all the individual modules have been developed and tested separately.



### Regression Testing

Goal is to ensure the recent changes do not adversely affect exist functionality of the system. Smoke Testing



### Performance Testing

Non-functional testing, focus on the various performance metrics

- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Scalability testing
- Stability testing



### A/B Testing

Also known as split testing. Compare two versions of products. 

One group is origin one and another one is the modified one.



### User Acceptance Testing

Final phase of software testing. Testing by the end users, verifies it meet the needs and agree-upon requirements.



## Environment Related

### Development

Developer development environment for developer write and test their code, can be local, remote, version control, sandbox, IDE

### QA

Quality assurance

To ensure the quality of application through testing.

Tools: Testing frameworks, automation tools (e.g., Selenium, JUnit), bug tracking software (e.g., Jira).

### Pre-prod

Pre-production mimics the production as closely as possible. It is used for performance testing, load testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and final verifications.

### Production

Final version of the software runs and accessed by real users. To deliver the final product or services to users.
