## HW 14
1. Unit Testing: Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a system in isolation to ensure that each unit behaves as expected.
2. Functional Testing:  Functional testing ensures that the system's functionality meets the specified requirements by testing the application from an end-user perspective.
3. Integration Testing: Integration testing checks how different modules or components of the application interact with each other.
4. Regression Testing: Regression testing ensures that new changes (e.g., bug fixes, new features) do not introduce new bugs or break existing functionality.
5. Smoke Testing: Smoke testing checks the basic functionality of the system to determine if it is stable enough for further testing.
6. Performance Testing: Performance testing evaluates the systemâ€™s speed, responsiveness, and stability under different conditions, such as load or stress.
7. A/B Testing: A/B testing compares two versions of a feature or interface to determine which performs better in terms of user engagement or other metrics.
8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): UAT is the final phase of testing where real users test the system to verify if it meets the business requirements.

### Environment-Related Concepts
1. Development: The environment where developers write, test, and debug code.
2. QA (Quality Assurance): The QA environment is where testers validate the quality of the software by running functional, integration, and other types of tests.
3. Pre-prod/Staging: The staging or pre-production environment is a close replica of the production environment used for final testing before a release.
4. Production: The live environment where the application is available to end-users.
