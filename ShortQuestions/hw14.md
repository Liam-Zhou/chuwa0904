# Homework: Software Testing Concepts and Unit Testing

## Part 1: Explanation and Comparison of Testing Concepts

### 1. Unit Testing
Unit Testing involves testing individual units or components of a software application. The primary focus is on verifying the correctness of isolated code, such as methods or functions. Developers typically write unit tests during the development process.

**Example**: Testing a function that calculates the sum of two numbers to verify it returns the correct result.

### 2. Functional Testing
Functional Testing focuses on testing the functionality of a particular component or module in the software. The goal is to ensure that the component behaves as expected according to the functional requirements.

**Example**: Testing a login form to ensure that it accepts correct username/password combinations and rejects incorrect ones.

### 3. Integration Testing
Integration Testing checks the interaction between multiple components or modules in a system. It ensures that the collaboration between components is correct and smooth.

**Example**: Testing the interaction between a web server and a database to ensure data retrieval and storage work properly.

### 4. Regression Testing
Regression Testing is performed after changes or updates are made to the software. The goal is to re-run previously executed tests to ensure no new errors have been introduced.

**Example**: After adding a new feature, re-testing the entire application to confirm that existing functionalities work as expected.

### 5. Smoke Testing
Smoke Testing is a preliminary test to check whether the software build is stable enough to undergo further testing. It's part of the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

**Example**: Verifying that a new build can be installed and basic features like launching the app work before deeper tests are conducted.

### 6. Performance Testing
Performance Testing evaluates the responsiveness and stability of a system under a specific workload. It ensures that the software meets performance requirements.

**Example**: Testing the response time of a website under heavy traffic to ensure it can handle 1000 concurrent users.

### 7. A/B Testing
A/B Testing compares two versions of a software feature to determine which one performs better in terms of user engagement or other metrics.

**Example**: Testing two different layouts of a webpage to see which one results in higher user sign-ups.

### 8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
UAT is performed by the end-user to verify that the software meets their needs and works under actual conditions. It is the final step before moving the software into production.

**Example**: Testing a business application by a group of users to confirm it meets their daily requirements.

## Part 2: Explanation of Environments

### 1. Development
The Development environment is where developers write and test their code. It is typically isolated from other environments and used to build and test new features before they are pushed further.

### 2. QA (Quality Assurance)
The QA environment is where quality assurance engineers perform testing. This environment mirrors production but is used to find bugs, run test cases, and verify that the application meets its requirements before it moves to production.

### 3. Pre-Prod/Staging
The Staging or Pre-Prod environment is an environment that closely mimics production. It is used to perform final testing before deploying to production. Everything in staging should behave like production.

### 4. Production
The Production environment is where the live application runs, and users interact with it. Any bugs or issues in this environment directly impact real users, so careful testing is done before anything reaches this stage.

## Part 3: Unit Test using JUnit and PowerMock


### Unit Test with JUnit and PowerMock

```java
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import org.powermock.api.mockito.PowerMockito;
import org.powermock.core.classloader.annotations.PrepareForTest;
import org.powermock.modules.junit4.PowerMockRunner;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.anyString;

@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
@PrepareForTest({HttpClientService.class, URL.class, HttpURLConnection.class})
public class HttpClientServiceTest {

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        PowerMockito.mockStatic(HttpClientService.class);
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetHttpResponse() throws Exception {
        // Mock URL and HttpURLConnection
        URL mockUrl = PowerMockito.mock(URL.class);
        HttpURLConnection mockConnection = PowerMockito.mock(HttpURLConnection.class);

        // Mock the input stream (response from API)
        BufferedReader mockReader = PowerMockito.mock(BufferedReader.class);
        PowerMockito.whenNew(BufferedReader.class).withAnyArguments().thenReturn(mockReader);
        PowerMockito.when(mockReader.readLine()).thenReturn("{ \"key\": \"value\" }", null);

        // Mock behavior for URL and connection
        PowerMockito.whenNew(URL.class).withArguments(anyString()).thenReturn(mockUrl);
        PowerMockito.when(mockUrl.openConnection()).thenReturn(mockConnection);
        PowerMockito.when(mockConnection.getInputStream()).thenReturn(PowerMockito.mock(InputStreamReader.class));
        PowerMockito.when(mockConnection.getResponseCode()).thenReturn(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK);

        // Call the static method
        String result = HttpClientService.getHttpResponse("https://api.github.com", "/users/{UserId}/repos?page=1", null, 1000, 1000);

        // Assert the response
        assertEquals("{ \"key\": \"value\" }", result);

        // Verify the connection was closed
        Mockito.verify(mockConnection).disconnect();
    }
}
