## Homework 14

### Testing Related Concepts

1. Unit Testing: This focuses on testing individual components of  code in isolation. In a Spring Boot application, we need to test a service method without involving the database or external services, only the logic.

 - Example: If you have a method that sums two numbers, you would write a unit test to verify that sum(2, 3) returns 5.

2. Functional Testing: This tests whether the software behaves as expected according to the requirements. It’s less about isolated components and more about verifying that a feature (or function) works correctly.

 - Example: In an e-commerce app, checking that the "Add to Cart" button actually adds an item to the cart is functional testing.

3. Integration Testing: This goes beyond unit tests by checking how different modules work together. 

 - Example: In a Spring Boot app, an integration test could check whether a service method correctly retrieves a user from the database by integrating both the service and the repository layer.

4. Regression Testing: This ensures that new code changes don’t break existing functionality. It’s important to run these tests when you add new features or fix bugs.

 - Example: After refactoring a function that updates user profiles, run regression tests to confirm that the rest of the app is still working as expected.

5. Smoke Testing: This is a quick round of tests to check if the most essential features of the app are working. It’s usually done after a new build to ensure it’s stable enough for further testing.

 - Example: In a login system, you’d test that users can still sign in and out after new changes.

6. Performance Testing: This evaluates how well your software performs under load, such as speed, scalability, and stability.

 - Example: For a web app, you could simulate multiple users logging in at once and see how the system handles the load.

7. A/B Testing: This is used to compare two versions of a feature to determine which one performs better.

 - Example: If you’re not sure whether to use a blue or red "Sign Up" button, A/B testing can help you measure which one gets more clicks.

8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): This is done by the end-users to verify if the system meets their needs before going live.

 - Example: Before launching a banking app, actual bank employees might use the app to ensure it functions correctly.

### Environment Related Concepts

1. Development: This is where developers write code and run initial tests. Bugs are expected and fixed here.

 - Example: Write and test code locally or in a development server.

2. QA (Quality Assurance): In this environment, testers verify the functionality and performance of the application. Automated and manual tests happen here.

 - Example: After passing development, the app is handed over to the QA team, who tests the app to find potential issues.

3. Pre-prod/Staging: This environment is almost identical to production and is used to test the app with real-world configurations before going live.

 - Example: Staging is where you deploy your final build and perform end-to-end testing before releasing it to real users.

4. Production: This is the live environment where real users interact with the system. It should be stable and reliable.

 - Example: Your application is deployed on the production server, where real users access it.
