- Docker daemon:Docker Daemon (dockerd) runs on a host machine and manages Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests and handles the building, running, and distribution of Docker containers
- Docker host: A physical or virtual machine where the Docker Daemon runs.
- Docker Registry: A centralized location to store Docker images.
- Image/Image Tag:A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
- Container: A container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. It includes the application and its dependencies, isolated from the host system.
- Volume: A volume in Docker is a way to persist data outside the lifecycle of a container. It allows data to be shared between containers and also between the host and the container.
- Docker Namespace vs Kubernetes Namespace: In Docker, namespaces provide a layer of isolation, allowing different processes to run independently on the same system. For example, each container runs in its own isolated namespace.
- Kubernetes Node: A node in Kubernetes is a worker machine (either physical or virtual) where containers run.
- Kubernetes Pod: A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It can contain one or more containers that share resources like storage and networking.
- Kubernetes Service: A service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them.
- Kubernetes ReplicaSet: A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
- Kubernetes Deployment: A deployment manages the lifecycle of an application, including creating, updating, and deleting pods
