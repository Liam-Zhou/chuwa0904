## Homework 16

### Docker Concepts:

1. Docker Daemon:

 - The background program that runs and manages Docker containers.

2. Docker Host:

 - The computer where Docker is running, like your PC or a server.

3. Docker Registry:

 - A place to store and share Docker images. Docker Hub is a well-known example.

4. Image/Image Tag:

 - An image is like a template to create containers. Tags are used to label different versions.

5. Container:

 - A running instance of an image. It’s like a lightweight mini-computer for your app.

6. Volume:

 - A way to save data outside of the container, so it doesn’t disappear when the container stops.

Docker Namespace vs Kubernetes Namespace:

 - Docker namespace: Isolates resources like files and networks for containers.
 - Kubernetes namespace: Organizes things in a cluster into separate groups.

### Kubernetes Concepts:

1. Kubernetes Node:

 - A machine that runs your app inside containers.

2. Kubernetes Pod:

 - A small unit that holds one or more containers that work together.

3. Kubernetes Service:

 - It helps pods communicate or lets users access your app from outside.

4. Kubernetes ReplicaSet:

 - Makes sure the right number of pods are running. If one fails, it starts a new one.

5. Kubernetes Deployment:

 - Manages ReplicaSets, lets you update or scale your app easily.
