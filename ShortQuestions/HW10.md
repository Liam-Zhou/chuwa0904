# HW10 Spring-MVC

## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from this class session.

1. @ComponentScan(basePackages = { "com.chuwa.training" }):

- Scans the specified base package for Spring components (like @Controller, @Service, @Repository, etc.).

2. @PutMapping(value = "/{id}", produces = "application/xml", consumes = "application/json"):

- Handles HTTP PUT requests.
- The value attribute defines the URL pattern.
- The produces attribute specifies the media type (e.g., XML) that the method will produce in the response.
- The consumes attribute specifies the media type (e.g., JSON) that the method expects in the request body.

3. @RestController:

- A convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.
- Used to simplify the creation of RESTful web services by returning the response directly as an object in the form of JSON or XML.

## 2. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?

Tight coupling: Tight coupling occurs when one class is highly dependent on another class for its functionality. This happens when one object or class needs to know a lot about the details of another object or class, making them closely connected.  
Loose coupling: Loose coupling means that classes are independent or have less dependence on each other. This is achieved by using interfaces, abstractions, or dependency injection to reduce direct dependencies between classes.

Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) is a core principle in the Spring Framework. It refers to a design principle where control over the creation and management of objects is transferred from the application to a framework (in this case, Spring).

## 3. What is MVC pattern?

The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is a software design pattern commonly used to develop web applications. It separates an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation helps in organizing code, improving maintainability, and promoting scalability.

## 4. What is Front-Controller?

The Front Controller is a design pattern commonly used in web application architectures. It defines a single entry point for handling all incoming client requests, instead of having multiple controllers handling different types of requests. This design is essential in frameworks like Spring MVC, ASP.NET MVC, and other web application frameworks.

## 5. Explain `DispatcherServlet` and how it workds.

In Spring MVC, the `DispatcherServlet` is the core component and acts as the Front Controller in the Front Controller Design Pattern. It is responsible for handling all incoming HTTP requests, dispatching them to the appropriate handlers (controllers), and returning the correct view or response to the client.

### Key Responsibilities of DispatcherServlet:

1. Intercepting Requests: It intercepts all incoming requests to the application and processes them.
2. Routing Requests: It determines which controller or handler is responsible for handling the request based on the URL and other configurations.
3. Delegating to Handlers: It delegates the request to the appropriate handler, which can be a controller or another component.
4. View Resolution: After the handler (controller) processes the request, DispatcherServlet decides which view (e.g., HTML, JSP, Thymeleaf, or JSON response) should be returned to the client.
5. Exception Handling: It manages exceptions that occur during request handling and allows centralized error handling.

### How DispatcherServlet Works:

1. Request Interception:

- DispatcherServlet intercepts all HTTP requests to the application.

2. Handler Mapping:

- It uses HandlerMapping to map the request URL to the appropriate controller.

3. Controller Execution:

- The mapped controller processes the request and returns a view name or response data (e.g., JSON).

4. View Resolution:

- The ViewResolver translates the view name into a specific view (e.g., a JSP, Thymeleaf template, etc.).

5. Response:

- The view is rendered or the data is returned, and DispatcherServlet sends the final response back to the client.

## 6. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView?

`JSP (JavaServer Pages)` is a server-side technology used for creating dynamic web content. It allows Java code and HTML to be mixed together in the same file, which is then processed on the server before being sent to the client. JSP files are compiled into servlets by the server and generate dynamic content (such as HTML, XML, or JSON) based on the server-side logic.

`ModelAndView` is a class used in Spring MVC to hold both the model data and the view name. It is returned by a controller method to indicate which view should be rendered and what data should be passed to that view.

## 7. Explain `servlet` and `servlet container`, name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than `tomcat`

A `Servlet` is a Java-based server-side component that handles HTTP requests and generates dynamic responses (usually in the form of HTML, JSON, or XML). Servlets run within a Servlet Container and are commonly used to develop web applications. They follow the Java Servlet API and are a core component of Java EE (Enterprise Edition)  
A `Servlet` Container (or Web Container) is the runtime environment in which servlets are executed. It manages the lifecycle of servlets, handles request-response communication, and provides important services like: Request dispatching. Session management. Thread pooling. Security (authentication, authorization). Connection management.

### Some servlet implementations include:

- HttpServlet (from javax.servlet.http): A widely used implementation that supports HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, etc.
- Other servlet implementations may extend or customize the basic HttpServlet class to add additional functionality.

### Some servlet containers:

1. Jetty: Jetty is a lightweight and highly scalable servlet container. It is often used in projects where embedded web servers are needed, such as in standalone applications or microservices.

- Usage: Embedded in Java applications (like in Eclipse IDE or Jenkins).

2. WildFly (formerly known as JBoss) is a full-fledged application server that supports Java EE specifications, including servlets, EJBs, and more.

- Usage: Large enterprise applications, Java EE development.

3. GlassFish is an open-source application server that implements the Java EE standard, including servlets. It's known for its comprehensive Java EE support.

- Usage: Java EE applications, development of enterprise web services.

4. Resin is a high-performance servlet container and Java application server. It's often used in environments where performance and reliability are critical.

- Usage: Enterprise web applications, high-traffic websites.

5. Apache Geronimo is an open-source application server that fully implements the Java EE specification, including servlet support.

- Usage: Java EE development, cloud services.

6. Undertow is a lightweight, embeddable servlet container, known for its performance and flexibility. It is often used as the web server in the WildFly application server.

- Usage: Microservices, lightweight web applications.
